TEXT INSTRUCTIONS SUMMARY:

1) Upload the contents inside the linguisticlibrary_v1.0.2
folder onto your server in whatever folder you want the software to be.

2) Create a new database in your hosting account (via phpMyAdmin) and
upload the linguisticlibrary_v1.sql file into it.

3) Inside the contents of the folder you uploaded, go to
 /includes/connectdb.php and change the following variables to your 
database's credentials: 

	$DB_USER = "replace_username_here";
	$DB_PASS = "replace_password_here";
	$DB_NAME = "replace_database_name_here";

(you have to create a new database via your webhost if you don't have one setup)

4) In your web browser, visit the homepage of the root folder where you
uploaded the folder contents. Click "Admin Access" in the footer to enter the Admin Panel. Use the credentials:

	user: abc@gmail.com
	pass: 123456

You'll be in the Dashboard of the Admin Panel, where you can start making
your changes. In the Admin Listing tab you can change your email and password.
BE SURE TO DO THAT! If you have any problems, you can visit our support forum
